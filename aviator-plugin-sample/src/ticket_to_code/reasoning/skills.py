"""
CC4E Skill layer for the reasoning kernel.

A Skill is CC4E-specific knowledge for a class of tickets. It does two things:

  1. ADVISES the kernel: which capabilities (tools) to prefer, which validators
     must pass, and which mistakes to avoid.  These are grounded in the real
     CC4E architecture (Spring Boot 3.x / Java 17, Angular 19, Flyway, sagas-lib,
     Spring Cloud Stream + RabbitMQ).
  2. SEEDS deterministic knowledge via prepare(): LLM keyword expansion,
     Brain index lookups, and Feature Graph owner resolution — so the kernel
     starts every ticket from a strong, project-specific position.

The reasoning kernel stays in control.  Skills never execute the loop — they make
the kernel start from a strong, project-specific position (the CC4E advantage).

Design:
  Skill.matches(...)  -> is this skill relevant to the ticket?
  Skill.prepare(ctx)  -> deterministic seeding (returns a short summary string)
  select_skill(...)   -> pick the best-match skill (priority-scored, not first-match)

Playbook definitions below were generated from a deep analysis of the CC4E
codebase (C:/CC4E): project-service, area-service, issues-service,
ene-load-service, sagas-service, bim-gateway, se-connector-apis, xchange-ui.

#   Layered: controller -> service(/impl) -> repository(JPA) -> entity/dto,

#   Schema: Flyway migrations in src/main/resources/db/migration.
#   Async: Spring Cloud Stream + RabbitMQ (StreamBridge) and sagas-lib.
#   UI: Angular 19 (NgModules + some standalone), selector prefix 'se-',
