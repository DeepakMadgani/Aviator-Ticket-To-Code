"""Change B — RAG/semantic is part of Evidence Collection, and PRIMARY_FEATURE_TARGET
is proven by INSPECTION before planning.

Invariants proved here:
    RAG_RELEVANCE != OWNERSHIP
    FILENAME_MATCH != OWNERSHIP   (filename only lowers the behavioral-confidence bar)
    RELATIONSHIP  != WRITE_PERMISSION
    SURFACE -> INSPECT -> PROVE -> (primary) -> AUTHORIZE

Pure logic; no LLM/workspace. The ordering test builds the real LangGraph with a
stubbed WorkflowAgents.
