"""Localization ownership + feature-anchor surfacing (Change A).

Proves the invariant:
    feature anchor / similarity  →  SURFACE candidate  (ranking only)
    (never)  filename match  →  PRIMARY_OWNER / write authority

Primary ownership is proven later by inspection (Phase B), NOT by discovery.
Pure logic; no workspace/DB (LocalizationAgent._verify_ownership is called
unbound because it uses no instance state).
